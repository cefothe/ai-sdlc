## Project context (read before acting)

1. **A SPECIFICATION / BUG FIX / SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE block in your prompt is the contract.** Work from it first.
2. **Otherwise — or when your work reaches beyond that block — consult the project's own documentation:**
   - `docs/architecture/overview.md`: components and the code each owns, the contracts that connect them, data ownership, invariants (monorepo: also `<subproject>/docs/architecture/overview.md`)
   - `docs/architecture/features/<feature>.md`: one feature / user journey across every component it touches — participants, end-to-end interactions, contracts, data ownership (`architecture_lookup` with `feature`)
   - `docs/product/context.md`: personas, glossary, current capabilities, regulatory constraints
   - the task's PRD (`docs/prd/`), design doc (`docs/design/`) or bug report (`docs/bugs/`), and the ADRs in `.ai-sdlc/_decisions/`
3. **Use the lookup tools when you have them:** ai-sdlc-context (`architecture_lookup`, `architecture_contracts`, `product_lookup`, `spec_lookup`, `decision_lookup`) and cxpak (`cxpak_graph` trace / blast_radius, `cxpak_insight` architecture / conventions; or `cxpak overview --tokens 6k [--workspace <subproject>]` via Bash). Never use cxpak's `cxpak_context` op `context` — it ignores the token budget.
4. **Never guess** which component owns a file, how two components connect, or what a domain term means — look it up. If it is not documented, say so and flag it instead of inventing it.
5. **Change code only in the component that owns it**, connect only through declared contracts, honor every invariant and recorded ADR. If one blocks the task, stop and flag it.
